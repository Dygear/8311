## Docs Website

The website's content aims to be clean and professional. It aids the community with their pon-related needs and 
helps potential sponsors understand what we are all about!

To contribute to existing guides and/or create new ones, the markdown files can be found within the 
[posts directory](./docs/guides/posts).

Screenshots are created in [Epiphany](https://apps.gnome.org/Epiphany/) at a 1920x1080p resolution and converted to 
webp with [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) using 60% resolution e.g. 
`cwebp -q 60 screenshot.jpg -o screenshot.webp`.

The artwork is created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and mixed with assets from 
[@storyset](https://www.freepik.com/author/stories) on Freepik. When finished, the artwork is exported at a 1280x960p 
resolution and converted to webp with the same utility and options as the screenshots.

## Issues

Issues can be reported here on github or our [community discord server](https://discord.pon.wiki). Pull requests are 
especially welcome.
